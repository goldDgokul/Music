        Lady, hear me tonight
        'Cause my feeling is just so right
        As we dance by the moonlight
        Can't you see you're my delight?

        Lady, I just feel like
        I won't get you out of my mind
        I feel love for the first time
        And I know that it's true
        I can tell by the look in your eyes

        Lady, hear me tonight
        'Cause my feeling is just so right
        As we dance by the moonlight
        Can't you see you're my delight?

        Lady, I just feel like
        I won't get you out of my mind
        I feel love for the first time
        And I know that it's true
        I can tell by the look in your eyes

        Lady, hear me tonight
        'Cause my feeling is just so right
        As we dance by the moonlight
        Can't you see you're my delight?

        Lady, I just feel like
        I won't get you out of my mind
        I feel love for the first time
        And I know that it's true
        I can tell by the look in your eyes

        Lady, hear me tonight
        'Cause my feeling is just so right
        Lady, I just feel like
        I feel love for the first time

        Lady, hear me tonight
        Can't you see you're my delight?
        Lady, I just feel like
        I won't get you out of my mind

        Lady, hear me tonight
        'Cause my feeling is just so right
